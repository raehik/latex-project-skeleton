% Font(s) for LaTeX.

% Use Latin Modern font, supports T1 & intended as a successor to Computer
% Modern, the default font (which only supports OT1).
% See: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1390
% Note: if you're using your own font in XeLaTeX, you might want to remove this
% line. Might save some space. But it's otherwise a very good base, so I keep it
% in the general preamble.
