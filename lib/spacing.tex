% Margins, vertical spacing, single/double spaces, etc.

% Decrease margins a bit (so more page space used).
% Note: I suggest keeping the default unless you have specific margin reqs. for
% your work or you need to save paper, since they were chosen for typography
% purposes by people who know a lot about that stuff.
%\usepackage[margin=1.25in]{geometry}

% Use only 1 space at end of sentence, instead of default 2
% Note: there are *still* debates about this. Make your own decision: I don't
% bother changing it from default.
%\frenchspacing

% Add vertical spacing between paragraphs & remove indent.
% Note: basically a "make it Word" package.
%\usepackage{parskip}
% For parskip: keep the default 15pt indent (so just add vertical spacing)
%\setlength{\parindent}{15pt}
