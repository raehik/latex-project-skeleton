%% Encoding (highly suggested) {{{
% Note: as of 2016-03-21 there is pretty much no situation in which you *don't*
%       want these. T1 is better than OT1 and allowing UTF-8 characters means
%       you won't get any funny stuff occurring.

% Better kerning etc. for accented characters and so on.
% Use T1 8-bit encoding, e.g. actual 'ä' character rather than placing
% diacritic mark '¨' on top of 'a'. Fixes copying and pasting such characters!
% See: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/664
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow more than just ASCII input in files (e.g. ä rather than \"a).
% Note: this is seperate from fontenc (it's about inputting characters).
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% Note: make sure you have \usepackage{lmodern} somewhere (it should be in the
%       general preamble). It's an improvement over the default font Computer
%       Modern and supports T1 (while Computer Modern doesn't).
%% }}}

%% Other fonts {{{
% Specify document font style.
%   \rmdefault : Serif (Roman)
%   \sfdefault : Sans-serif
%   \ttdefault : Monospace (typewriter)
% Default is serif. Little reason to change unless you want to look like a Word
% document.
%\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\rmdefault}
%% }}}

%% CJK {{{
% Allow usage of CJK characters with `\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{font}`.
%\usepackage{CJKutf8}
%% }}}
